# University-of-Hderabad-Transportation-Department
## Description
The following information has been extracted during interviews with the client and represents the complete `Universe of Discourse` :

Staff members may use the vehicles owned by `UH (University of Hyderabad)` for officially approved travel. For example university vehicles may be used by staff members to travel between campuses, to off-campus learning centres, to locations at which research papers are presented, and to travel for public service purposes.

Using `reservation forms`, each department may reserve vehicles for its staff members. A `department` is identified by a departmental code, and described by its name, and location that consists of Building no. Name and Campus, e.g. 78, AILAB, Gachibowli. All UH staff members have a unique `staff ID`. A staff member belongs to exactly one department. Employees of UHTD (University of Hyderabad Transport department) are also UH staff, but unlike other staff, their driving licence number is also recorded. 

The reservation form includes the expected departure date/time, vehicle type required, destination, and the name of the authorized staff member. When the staff member arrives to pick up the vehicle, (s)he must sign a check-out form to log the vehicle out and pick up a trip completion form. The UHTD employee who releases the vehicle for use also signs the check-out form and records the actual date/time of pickup. 

The staff are responsible for filling out the appropriate trip completion form at the end of each trip. The staff member’s trip completion form includes the staff member’s ID, the vehicle’s identification, the odometer readings at the start and end of the trip, maintenance complaints (if any), litres of fuel purchased (if any) and the UH credit card used to pay for the fuel. Upon receipt of the faculty trip completion form, the staff member’s department is billed at a kilometre rate based on the vehicle type (sedan, station wagon, utility vehicle, minivan, minibus) used.

All `vehicle maintenance` is performed by UHTD. Each time a vehicle requires maintenance, a maintenance log entry is completed on a pre-numbered maintenance log form. The maintenance log form includes the vehicle identification, a brief description of the type of maintenance required, the initial log entry date. The remaining entries on the form are left blank at this time, and filled in after completion of the vehicle maintenance.

As soon as the log form has been initiated, the log form’s number is transferred to a maintenance detail form; the log form’s number is also forwarded to the parts department manager, who fills out a parts usage form on which the maintenance log number is recorded. The maintenance detail form contains separate lines for each maintenance item performed, the parts used (one maintenance item may use several parts), the identification of the mechanic who performed the maintenance item. Mechanics are UH staff members, but have additional attributes regarding training level (1-5) and their authority level (basic, inspection). When all the maintenance items have been completed, the maintenance log form’s completion date is filled out, and the details of the mechanic who releases the vehicle back to service are recorded (Only mechanics who have an inspection authorization may release the vehicle back into service). Both forms are then used later as the source for various maintenance reports.

UHTD maintains a `parts inventory` , including oil filters, air filters, and belts of various types. Every part has a unique part no. The parts inventory is monitored daily to track parts usage and to reorder parts that reach the “minimum quantity on hand” level.
